Here's a comprehensive overview of the StudyAI project:
Project Overview
StudyAI is an AI-powered study assistant web application that helps students transform their study materials into interactive learning tools. The application leverages GPT-4 Turbo to automatically generate flashcards, quizzes, and comprehensive study guides from uploaded documents.
Purpose
The main purpose is to demonstrate practical applications of generative AI in education by:
•  Automating the creation of study materials
•  Providing multiple learning formats (flashcards, quizzes, study guides)
•  Making study material more interactive and engaging
•  Saving students time in creating study materials
Technical Architecture
Frontend:
•  Next.js 14 (React framework)
•  TypeScript for type safety
•  TailwindCSS for styling
•  Shadcn/UI for component library
•  Client-side state management with React hooks
Backend:
•  Next.js API routes (hybrid Pages/App Router)
•  SQLite database for data persistence
•  File system storage for uploaded documents
•  OpenAI API integration (GPT-4 Turbo)
•  PDF parsing with pdf-parse
•  Document text extraction pipeline
Key Components:
•  Document Management:
•  Upload system for PDF documents
•  Text extraction and processing
•  Document storage and retrieval
•  AI Integration:
•  OpenAI API wrapper
•  Prompt engineering for different study formats
•  Response parsing and validation
•  Study Tools:
•  Flashcard generation and display
•  Quiz generation with multiple choice
•  Study guide generation with hierarchical sections
•  PDF export functionality
How It Works
•  Document Upload Flow:
User Upload → File Processing → Text Extraction → Database Storage
•  AI Generation Flow:
User Request → Content Retrieval → AI Processing → Format Conversion → UI Display
•  Study Material Generation:
•  Flashcards: AI generates question-answer pairs
•  Quizzes: AI creates multiple-choice questions with correct answers
•  Study Guides: AI organizes content into hierarchical sections
